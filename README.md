# Spray-coating-Gcode-generation
This repository hosts the python code to generate a Gcode for spray coating, and the arduino routines used to convert a 3D printer into an automatic spraying machine.
If interested you should look into the wiki where a lot of information are provided to explain the code's function.

The method to convert a printer is explained on Instructables:

While the 3D files for printing are available on thingiverse:

You can see a demonstration of the setup on YouTube:
